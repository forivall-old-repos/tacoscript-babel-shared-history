## API

In this directory you'll find all the public interfaces to generate tacoscript from javascript for both node and the browser.

### Node

The general way to use tacogen in node is to convert someone else's code before hacking on it. The api here is `tacogen.transform` or `tacogen.parse`.

### Browser

Usage of tacogen in the browser is primarily for demos.
